## Welcome

This is a repo to store C64 programs written by my child in a way that they can be previewed in a browser window.

The browser emulation is based on https://github.com/luxocrates/viciious , some minor modifications are done to get the new programs included.

HP quiz C64 : [HP House and Wand quiz online demo](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/zeratulok/c64/blob/main/viciious.html)

For more information how the emulator works, visit the [Viciious](https://github.com/luxocrates/viciious) page
