## Welcome

This is a repo to store **C64 programs** written by my child in a way that they can be previewed in a browser window.

The first app is a **H.P. quiz game written in BASIC**, [**click**](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/zeratulok/c64/blob/main/viciious.html) on this link to try it out: [C64 HP House and Wand quiz online demo](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/zeratulok/c64/blob/main/viciious.html)

The browser emulation is based on https://github.com/luxocrates/viciious , some minor modifications are done to get the new programs included.

For more information on how the emulator works, visit the [Viciious](https://github.com/luxocrates/viciious) page
